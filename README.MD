This project is for opening the right contact page in monica based on the currently opened contact in whatsapp desktop.

It abuses the remote debugging port which you can set when starting the application. 

On Mac the command for that is:

```
open /Applications/WhatsApp.app --args --remote-debugging-port=8315
```
